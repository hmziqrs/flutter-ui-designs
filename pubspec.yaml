flutter:
  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/thumbnails/healthy_food_delivery.png
    - assets/ma-hfd/item-1.jpg
    - assets/ma-hfd/item-2.jpg
    - assets/ma-hfd/item-3.jpg
  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Nunito
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-ExtraLight.ttf
          weight: 200
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Regular.ttf
          weight: 400
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-SemiBold.ttf
          weight: 600
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-ExtraBold.ttf
          weight: 800
        - asset: fonts/Nunito/Nunito-Black.ttf
          weight: 900
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
